# ðŸ”„ Extension Reload Instructions

## Issue
The extension is getting permission errors for eBay URLs because it needs to be reloaded to pick up the new manifest permissions.

## Solution

### Step 1: Reload the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find the "eCom Miracle" extension
3. Click the **refresh/reload button** (ðŸ”„) next to the extension
4. Or toggle the extension **OFF** and then **ON** again

### Step 2: Verify Permissions
After reloading, the extension should have permissions for:
- `https://www.ebay.com/*`
- `https://www.ebay.co.uk/*`
- `https://www.ebay.de/*`
- `https://www.ebay.fr/*`
- `https://www.ebay.it/*`
- `https://www.ebay.es/*`
- `https://www.ebay.com.au/*`
- `https://www.ebay.ca/*`

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Go to the Competitor Scanner
2. Run the scanner with test sellers
3. Check that no permission errors appear in console
4. Go to "Show Results in Ebay Grabber"
5. Data should now be displayed

1. Navigate to an eBay page (e.g., https://www.ebay.co.uk)
