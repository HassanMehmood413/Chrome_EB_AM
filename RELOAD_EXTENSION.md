## Issue
The extension is getting permission errors for eBay URLs because it needs to be reloaded to pick up the new manifest permissions.

## Solution

### Step 1: Reload the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find the "eCom Miracle" extension
3. Click the **refresh/reload button** (🔄) next to the extension
4. Or toggle the extension **OFF** and then **ON** again

### Step 2: Verify Permissions
